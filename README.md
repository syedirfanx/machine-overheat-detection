# Machine Overheat Detection
### CSE 323 Operating Systems Design
This project can be used in places like factories or industries consisting of big machines where it is very necessary to take some action in case the machine is overheated. Because in open eyes we donâ€™t get it if our machines are over heated or not. It is important to keep the machine under maintenance weather it gets over heated. As machine needs not to be over tempered to work efficiently.
